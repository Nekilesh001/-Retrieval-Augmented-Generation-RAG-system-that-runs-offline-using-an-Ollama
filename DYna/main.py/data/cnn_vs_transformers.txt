Title: CNN vs Transformer for Image Classification

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have long dominated image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies using convolutional layers.

Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a strong alternative. Unlike CNNs, ViTs use self-attention mechanisms, allowing them to model long-range dependencies in images. However, they typically require more data and computational power to train effectively.

CNNs remain more efficient on smaller datasets and are widely used in real-time systems. Transformers offer better generalization on large-scale datasets and have become state-of-the-art on several benchmarks.

Conclusion: For small to medium image tasks, CNNs are still the go-to. For large-scale or multi-modal tasks, Transformers are preferred.

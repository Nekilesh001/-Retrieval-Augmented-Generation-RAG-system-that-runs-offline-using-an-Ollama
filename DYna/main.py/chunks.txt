Title: CNN vs Transformer for Image Classification

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have long dominated image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies using convolutional layers.

Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a strong alternative. Unlike C

NNs, ViTs use self-attention mechanisms, allowing them to model long-range dependencies in images. However, they typically require more data and computational power to train effectively.

CNNs remain more efficient on smaller datasets and are widely used in real-time systems. Transformers offer bett

er generalization on large-scale datasets and have become state-of-the-art on several benchmarks.

Conclusion: For small to medium image tasks, CNNs are still the go-to. For large-scale or multi-modal tasks, Transformers are preferred.


Title: Summary of Machine Learning Research Trends (2021-2024)
Machine learning has seen exponential growth in applications ranging from NLP and computer
vision to healthcare and finance.
Key Trends:
1. Transformer architectures have revolutionized both language and vision domains.
2. Transfer learn

ing enables reusing pretrained models across tasks.
3. Few-shot and zero-shot learning reduce the need for labeled data.
4. Robustness, interpretability, and fairness have become top priorities.
5. Open-source datasets and models have accelerated innovation.
Conclusion:
The ML landscape is evolving 

toward foundation models and adaptive systems, driven by compute
power and data availability.
